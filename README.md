# Domain-Specific_Hybrid_Refinement_Inversion
Official implementation of "What Decreases Editing Capability? Domain-Specific Hybrid Refinement for Improved GAN Inversion"

:tada: We will release our codes in early Feburary.

:tada: DHR will be integrated in our [GANInverter](https://github.com/caopulan/GANInverter). And this version will be better, for it can be applied with all supported embedding methods, e.g., DHR+e4e, DHR+pSp, DHR+LSAP, DHR+Optimization.
